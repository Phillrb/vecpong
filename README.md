# vecpong
A pong clone for the GCE / Milton Bradley Vectrex games console (circa 1982)
Programmed in C with <a href="https://github.com/Phillrb/vec-c">Vec-C</a> and developed in Xcode for Mac OSX.
The BIN file can be used in any Vectrex emulator and is available here: <a href="./vecpong/vecpong/vecpong.bin">vecpong.bin</a>

Vecpong is fun in and of itself but was really constructed as a demonstration of the use of <a href="https://github.com/Phillrb/vec-c">Vec-C</a> (a means of programming Vectrex games in C, rather then assembly, and consisting mainly of a glue layer that bridges the two). Packed alongside it is an Xcode template (supporting 'File -> New -> Project' in Xcode) so that it's easy to get up and running with new games.
