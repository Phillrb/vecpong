# vecpong
A complete 2-player pong clone for the GCE / Milton Bradley Vectrex games console (circa 1982). 

Programmed in C with <a href="https://github.com/Phillrb/vec-c">Vec-C</a> and developed in Xcode for Mac OSX. The BIN file can be used in any Vectrex emulator and is available here: <a href="./vecpong/vecpong.bin">vecpong.bin</a>

Vecpong is fun in and of itself but was really constructed as a demonstration of the use of <a href="https://github.com/Phillrb/vec-c">Vec-C</a> (a means of programming Vectrex games in C, rather then assembly, and consisting mainly of a glue layer that bridges the two). Vec-C is delivered as an Xcode template (supporting 'File -> New -> Project' in Xcode) so that it's easy to get up and running with new games. An installer will soon be avilable for all its dependencies (Assembler, linker, compiler etc).
